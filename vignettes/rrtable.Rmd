If you are a data scientist or researcher, you will certainly be interested in reproducible research. I have developed several functions to make reports with variable formats from R code. 

## Package Installation

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("cardiomoon/rrtable")
```

## Package Loading

You can load the `rrtable` package with the folowing R command.
```{r}
require(rrtable)
```

## Sample Data 

Sample data `sampleData2` is included in rrtable package. You can see the sampleData2 by folllowing R command.

```{r}
str(sampleData2)
```

Or you can make a table of this data

```{r}
df2flextable(sampleData2)
```

### Make a Report As a Powerpoint Format.

You can make report with a powerpoint format.

```{r,eval=FALSE}
data2pptx(sampleData2,echo=TRUE)
```

### Make a Report As a MS-Word Format.

You can make report with a docx format.

```{r,eval=FALSE}
data2word(sampleData2)
```

### Make a Report As a HTML Format.

You can make report with a HTML format.

```{r,eval=FALSE}
data2HTML(sampleData2)
```

### Make a Report As a pdf Format.

You can make report with a pdf format. A LaTex should be installed to your computer to get 'pdf' file.

```{r,eval=FALSE}
data2pdf(sampleData2)
```

### Make a zipped plot file 

You can get a zipped plot file. Available format is 'PNG','SVG' and 'PDF'. 

```{r,eval=FALSE}
data2plotzip(sampleData2,format="PNG")
```

You can set the width, height, resolution, units of your plots. You can see the manual of this function by entering the following command.

```{r}
?data2plotzip
```

## The Shiny Module 'pptxList' for developer

If you are a shiny app develper, you can use my 'pptxList' shiny module in your app. Please try the sample shiny app.  

```{r,eval=FALSE}
shiny::runApp(system.file('pptxList',package='rrtable'))
```


```{r,echo=FALSE,fig.height=5,fig.width=7}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cardiomoon/rrtable/master/man/figures/1.png")
```

After loading the shiny app, please click the 'load sample Data' button. You can edit the sample data by clicking 'edit Data' button. You can download report as a "HTML" or "docx" or "pptx" format. You can download report as a 'pdf' file(You have to set the LaTex in your computer).

The followings are the source codes of this app. The source file is very simple. After loading a required package, only three rows of R code make a shiny app. You can use this module in your app freely.

```{r,eval=FALSE}
library(shiny)
library(rrtable)
library(ggplot2)

ui=fluidPage(
    pptxListInput("pptxlist")
)
server=function(input,output,session){
     mydf=callModule(pptxList,"pptxlist")
}
shinyApp(ui,server)
```
